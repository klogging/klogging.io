# Configuration with JSON

Klogging can be configured from JSON files. This example is exactly equivalent to
the [first DSL example](dsl#a-simple-example):

```json
{
  "sinks": {
    "stdout": {
      "renderWith": "RENDER_SIMPLE",
      "sendTo": "STDOUT"
    },
    "seq": {
      "seqServer": "http://localhost:5341"
    }
  },
  "logging": [
    {
      "fromLoggerBase": "com.example",
      "levelRanges": [
        {
          "fromMinLevel": "INFO",
          "toSinks": ["stdout"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note
An earlier version used the key `dispatchTo` instead of `sendTo`. Use of `dispatchTo` is deprecated;
a warning will be printed to the console if it is found in JSON configuration.

## Configuration object names

### `sinks`

Equivalent to the [sinks](dsl#sink) DSL function. Object keyed by sink name with keys:

- `renderWith`: name of a [built-in renderer](built-ins#rendering). Current values are `RENDER_SIMPLE`,
  `RENDER_ANSI`, `RENDER_CLEF` and `RENDER_GELF`.

- `sendTo`: name of a [built-in sender](built-ins#sending). Current values are `STDOUT` and
  `STDERR`.

- `seqServer`: URL of a [Seq server](https://datalust.co) where events are to be dispatched. By default,
  the RENDER_CLEF renderer is used.

- `splunkServer`: connection details for a [Splunk server](https://www.splunk.com):
  - `hecUrl`: URL of the Splunk serverâ€™s HEC endpoint (HTTPS by default).
  - `hecToken`: the HEC token used by Splunk for these logging events. It is a secret
    that should be passed in via an environment variable.
  - `index` is the Splunk index for the events set up by a Splunk administrator (default `main`).
  - `sourceType` is the Splunk `sourcetype` value (default `klogging`).
  - `checkCertificate` indicates whether Klogging should check the TLS certificate used by the
    Splunk server (default `true`).

An example of a Splunk sink called `splunk` is:

```json
{
  "splunk": {
    "splunkServer": {
      "hecUrl": "https://localhost:8088",
      "hecToken": "${SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN}",
      "index": "main",
      "sourceType": "klogging",
      "checkCertificate": false
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
`splunkServer` takes precedence over `seqServer`, which takes precedence over `sendTo`
if multiple are present.
:::

:::info
The `sinks` object is evolving and there will be more options in the future.
:::

### `logging`

Equivalent to the [logging](dsl#logging) DSL function. Array of objects, each with keys:

- `fromLoggerBase` (optional): base name to match logger names.

- `exactLogger` (optional): exact name of logger to match.

:::caution
`exactLogger` takes precedence if both are specified in a `logging` object.
:::

:::info
If you specify neither key, all loggers will match. This configuration is the equivalent of the root logger in
Log4j or Logback.
:::

### `levelRanges`

Array of objects, each with keys:

- `fromMinLevel`: Name of the minimum level for log events to be emitted. For example, if the value is `INFO` then
  events at severity `INFO`, `ERROR` and
  `FATAL` will be emitted. Equivalent to the [fromMinLevel](dsl#fromminlevel-and-atlevel) DSL function.

- `atLevel`: Name of the exact level at which log events will be emitted. Equivalent to
  the [atLevel](dsl#fromminlevel-and-atlevel) DSL function.

- `toSinks`: Array of sink names where events will be sent. If it does not match a key of the `sinks` object, a
  warning is written to the console and the configuration is ignored.

:::caution
You must specify at least one `levelRange` object with at least one matching sink name or no logs will be
emitted.
