# Structured log events

Klogging uses log events that can contain much richer information than a simple message. Log events
have inbuilt properties – including timestamp, severity level, logger name – that describe the
immediate context where the event was generated. See [Log Events](concepts/log-events.md) for more
information.

## More context

The context of a log event is valuable information to be included with the event. You can add more
[context](context/context.md) to events by using [message templates](context/context.md)
